## Build with
- HTML
- CSS:
     - Flexbox
     - Grid
 
 ## Challenges I faced
 - Creating a CSS grid for the <b>Projects</b> turned out to be a little challenging than i expected
 - Realized that selecting the colour theme for your website is indeed a tricky part.

## Future Implementation
- Will Add more projects.
- Will Add more skills in the "Skills" section (Fingers crossed).
- Will add animations, since they enhance the UX.
